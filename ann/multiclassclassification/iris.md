# Iris Classification Using Deep Neural Network (Sequential Model)

In this task, I developed a classification model using the Sequential API of TensorFlow.

**Experiments conducted:**
- Tested multiple optimizers: Adam, SGD, and RMSprop, with various hyperparameters.
- Experimented with different activation functions and their combinations.
- Explored different numbers of hidden layers in the Sequential model.

**Best results:**
- The best performance was achieved with Adam optimizer, Dropout, and ReLU activation layers.
- SGD (with momentum = 0.9) and ReLU also performed well.
